## Introduction
Welcome to the Visual AI Projects repository! üéâ

This repository is dedicated to showcasing various projects that leverage visual artificial intelligence technologies. These projects are built using state-of-the-art libraries and frameworks in the field of AI and computer vision. Whether you are a seasoned AI practitioner or a curious beginner, this repository has something for you.

### What's Inside? üì¶
- **Face Recognition Project**: A project that uses deep learning models to recognize and verify human faces.
- **Object Detection Project**: A project aimed at detecting and classifying objects within images and videos.
- **Medical Image Processing Project**: A project focused on processing and analyzing medical images to assist in diagnosis and treatment.

## List of Projects
1. **Face Recognition Project**: This project utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to accurately identify and recognize human faces in images. It can be used in security systems, user authentication, and more.
2. **Object Detection Project**: Using advanced object detection algorithms like YOLO (You Only Look Once) and SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector), this project can detect and classify multiple objects in real-time.
3. **Medical Image Processing Project**: This project applies AI techniques to process medical images such as X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans. It helps in identifying anomalies, segmenting organs, and improving diagnostic accuracy.
